# telescope-app
my second attempt at writing a burp alternative app in Rust. does not do much at the moment other than let you see requests at a glance
## what it should do
* allow you to search through requests without a paid subscription lol
* easy to use modular plugins system
* epic looking gui (hard)
## bugs
* [text wrapping impossible within flow list](https://github.com/PPakalns/egui_taffy/issues/3)
